**Aim:**  
To successfully install PostgreSQL, configure the JDBC driver, and integrate them into a Java project created with the Java extension in Visual Studio Code.

**Procedure:**

1. **Download PostgreSQL:**
   - Visit the official PostgreSQL website.
   - Download the PostgreSQL installer suitable for your operating system (Windows).

2. **Install PostgreSQL:**
   - Run the downloaded installer.
   - Follow the installation wizard instructions.
   - Choose the installation directory and data directory.
   - The default port number is 5432.
   - Set a password for the default PostgreSQL user (postgres).
   - After installation, you can SQL Shell (psql) or pgAdmin to create databases and tables.
   - Enter the password you set during installation.

3. **Download JDBC Driver:**
   - Visit the PostgreSQL JDBC Driver download page.
   - Download the latest JDBC driver (JAR file).
   - For example, download the `postgresql-42.7.3.jar` file.

4. **Download and Configure Visual Studio Code (VS Code):**
   - Visit the Visual Studio Code website.
   - Download the installer suitable for your operating system (Windows).
   - Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard instructions.
   - Open VS Code and go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X).
   - Search for "Java Extension Pack" and click "Install."

5. **Create Java Project Structure:**
   - Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
   - Use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
   - To create an empty Java project, Type "Java: Create Java Project" and select project type as 'No Build Tools'.
   - Enter a project name (e.g., "JDBC") and choose a location to create the project.
   - The project will include directories like `bin`, `lib`, and `src` with an initial Java file (`App.java`) in the `src` directory.

5. **Add JDBC Driver to Referenced Libraries:**
   - Inside your project's `lib` directory, place the downloaded JDBC driver (eg., postgresql-42.7.3.jar).
   - The java extension pack will automatically add the `lib` directory to the classpath. So, you don't need to manually add the JAR file to the classpath.

6. **Write Java Code:**
   - Modify or create Java source files within the `src` folder of your project.
   - Write Java code to connect to PostgreSQL using the JDBC driver. Import the necessary classes.

7. **Compile and Run Your Java Code:**
   - Make sure you have the PostgreSQL service running.
   - You can run the code by clicking the "Run" option in the context menu or using the shortcut F5 key.
   - Open the integrated terminal in VS Code and navigate to your project directory.
   - Compile your Java code using the `javac` command, specifying the classpath for the JDBC driver and output directory.

        ```bash
     javac -cp lib/postgresql-42.7.3.jar -d bin src/App.java
     ```
   - Run your Java program using the `java` command, specifying the classpath for the JDBC driver and the main class.

        ```bash
      java -cp bin;lib/postgresql-42.7.3.jar App
      ```

**Result:**  
You will have successfully installed PostgreSQL, integrated the JDBC driver into your Java project, and written Java code capable of connecting to PostgreSQL using JDBC within the Visual Studio Code environment.
